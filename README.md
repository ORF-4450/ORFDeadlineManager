# Welcome to the Olympia Robotics Federation Deadline Manager!

## FAQ
Q: What does this do?

A: Creates and displays deadlines on TVs inside of Portable 9


Q: How do I set it up? 

A: Download the "Application Files" file. That file has the latest version of the deadline manager, as well as the files needed to run it. 
Move those files to somewhere easily accessible to you, and you're done!


Q: I want to make my own changes to the Deadline Manager, how do I do that?

A: Download the "Program Files" file. That file contains all of the developer files that were used to make the application. In order to make changes to those
files, make sure that you have Unity 5+ installed, or else those files will be worthless to you.


Q: I already have a list of deadlines from a previous build of the Deadline Manager. How do I see those deadlines in the new build?

A: In your old build of the Deadline Manager, you should have a file named ORFDM+_x.x_Data. Inside that file, find "DeadlineDB.xml". (ORFDM+_x.x_Data/StreamingAssets/XML/DeadlineDB.xml) 
Take that file, and put it in your new build of the Deadline Manager in the exact same place in the new build's Data file, replacing the existing DeadlineDB.xml file.
